    "On of the most appealing part of Data Science and Machine Learning is their joint ability to make data based predictions on future outcomes of the stock market, housing prizes or your next favorite show on Netflix. In addition, recent advances in neural network design as well as the increasing accessibility to computational power even facilitates object recognition towards self driving cars and self-teaching machines, which beat humans in Go and chess. However, all these wonderful applications are based on data. A lot of data. A lot of clean data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean data here is the key word and, in fact, most of the time you will spend as a data scientist on a project will be spend on cleaning & transforming data -- some say this makes up to 90 % of your time. Cleaning data encompasses a variety of taks, such as removing missing values, normalizing the data values of a numeric variable, subsetting the data, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broader picture data cleaning is part of the so-called *exploratory data analysis* where you as a data scientist take all the steps from data loading, through data processing and generating plots towards finding the right business use case. But first step first, let us load some nasty data and clean them up step by step."

    "However, as it turns out many features are considered numerical by python, which in fact are not numerical in terms of their actual data type; they just happen to carry integer values to describe different categories. This is a good example of why it is of paramount importance to look into the detail of the data set. Hence, data set always have to come with a clear documentation on the data set, the data types and maybe even how the data was collected. Fortunately, the guys putting together the Boston house price data set did a good job and you can find the 'data_description.txt' file in the main directory - take a look! \n",

What we are going to use here is a very powerful feature of pandas that is to apply a function to all row entries of a columm. We can do that by calling the .apply() method on a dataframe or dataframe subset. Inside the apply statement we use the lambda statement to in-line write a function that is going to applied to the selected data. It may look non-ituitive at first, but it is indeed very powerful and much, much fast than looping through all 1400 rows using a for loop."

    "By now, we have obtained a first picture of our data set. In the next step, we start tidying it up by looking for missing data entries. Missing data are a problem in so far as many of the commonly used algorithms in data science and machine learning cannot deal with them. You may run into issues even earlier on, as soon as you try plotting data that contain such missing entries. Hence, we want and need to get rid of them!\n",

    "In general, there is two different ways of dealing with missing data. One can kick out any rows and columns that contain missing data or try to fill the gaps by imputation. While the first approach, which I would call quick and dirty, always works from a technical perspective it carries the risk of deleting relevant information from your data set and/or drastically reducing your data set size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach, imputing the missing values is advantageuous in terms of keeping all your data in the set. However, it can generate variance in your data and, if one choose to impute by means of algorithms, can be computaionally expansive.\n",

    "The power of machine learning algorithms is to learn the correlation between features in the data set and a target variable. Say we want to model a regression model on the house price to predict the orice of future house sells. What our machine learn algorithm does here is to learn the correlations between the house properties stored in the features we have and the house price feature by numerically optimizing a function. In many cases this does work surprisingly well. However, once features become correlated with each other themselves, many algorithms cannot deal with this type of input data. In particular linear models, which are always an easy first try when running a regression, suffer badly from correlations across the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides us with a neat method to calculate the so-called correlation map between individual features. Using the heat map function from the seaborn library, we can visualize these correlations between the features. Be advised that, however, this approach only works that straight forward for numerical features. More as a side not, for categorical variables checking correlation between variables requires the application of a so-called chi-square test. For testing correlations between categorical and numerical features, a ANOVA test has to be performed. As you can see, understanding your data set can quickly bring you into the details of statistics. For that reason, we'll leave it for now by looking at correlation between numerical features."

    "EDA is about visualizing dependencies between different variables and extracting some first useful insights from your data. In fact, a lot of valueable knowledge in data science projects is often generated without using any fancy machine learning model. An easy EDA on clean data can aready help you, your company or your client to take the right decisions and ask the right questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, an EDA can become lengthy and it is about skill and experience to distill the relevant information our of your data set. For now, we here make a mini EDA in terms of visualizing a few dependencies across the data and learn about the variance of some variables. Let's get started!"

    "With Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we can remove correlation between variables, which will help us on our goal to make our data ready for modeling. In a nutshell, what PCA does is to orthogonalize all features with respect to each other. This way, correlations between features are removed. In addition to that, PCA reduces the amount of feature. In case, you are working on a data set with a large ampunt of features, this can be very helpful, since PCA effectively projects all information in a lower dimensional space. I this way, one could reduce the amount of features from say 100 to 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering our house price data, we'll do that now. First, we are going to convert all categorical features into dummy features. This is an important step, as PCA only works on numerical features. As an example, consider a categorical feature with 3 categories cat=[a,b,c]. What one typically does is to create three dummy features [cat_a, cat_b, cat_c]. If a data point is of category a, the dummies would read [cat_a, cat_b, cat_c]=[1,0,0], if it were of category b [cat_a, cat_b, cat_c]=[0,1,0] and so on. These dummy features are now numerical variables, which can in fact serve as input to any model. Let's do it, it's fairly simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before that, we want to remove the *SalePrice* and *Id* feature from our data set. The reason is that this is the very last step before modeling, where we convert the entire data set into a numerical matrix. Of course, we do not want to include our target variable, Saleprice, into that as well as the Id of each data point."

For that purpose one splits up the data sets into so-called training and test subsets, where the model is trained on the training set and its performance is tested on the test set. In this way, one can make sure that the model performance is tested on *unseen* data. The reason for that is that machine learning models can easily adjust themselves to tiny details of the training set and obtain great accuracy on that. However, once applied to unseed data, the performs poorly. This is called overfitting. To get an unambiguous estimate on the model performance, testing on unseen data is therefore required. \n",

    "Ridge regression is a linear regression model. Linear models try to fit a function to the input data by simply creating a linear model of the features such as y=a*feature1+b*feature2+c*feature3 +.... What happens during training is that the algorithm tries to adjust the model parameter a,b,c,... in order to find the otptimum functin to describe the target, in our case the housing price. To make linear models less prone to overfitting, they are expanded by an additional term, the L2 norm, in addtion. This term penalizes large training parameters, which is why such a model is called Ridge model. We won't go too much into the theory here, as this will be out of scope but you can find vast literature on details and tuning possibilities of linear models online.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Gradient Boosting Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, Let us also try a more complex model, the gradient boosting regressor, and see how well that does. Gradient boosting machines (GBM) are highly competitive tree-based machine learning algorithms, which often are the winner's choice in data science contests, for instance on Kaggle. In many examples, GBMs even outperform deep neural networks, which themselves are highly powerful and modern machine learning models. If you are interested in learning the details of that algorithm, this blogpost gives a good overview of how it works: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-gradient-boosting-gbm-python/\n",

    "Obviously, using GBM regression without even tuning the parameter gives you an increase of accuracy by 17 % compared to the linear model. That is a lot in the world of machine learning. Considering, that we haven't even trained our GBM model, you can imagine that there is a lot of optimization potential left.\n",

    "That's it. You have gone the full way from data loading, through data cleaning, data processing, data transformation to training a machine learning model -- awesome! We hoped you enjoyed doing that and that we ignited your interest in some concepts of data science and machine learning. We could only highlight a very little part of the data science and machine learning cosmos but hope to have taught you some general concepts of how a data science project may look like. Please tell us which part of this lecture and exercises you liked and also, which parts you didn't like. This way, we can do a better job next time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning more about data science, Kaggle provides you with great resources. It has a vast amount of different data sets to play with, maintained tutorials on python, data science, deep learning, etc. and a lot of people share their knowledge and tutorials, which may be very helpful to you. www.Kaggle.com -- you should check it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are more interested in online classes that include videos, homework assessments and a certificate you may want to check out Coursera. There are indeed great courses on data science and meachine learning tought by leading professors in that field. Usually, these classes can be accessed by paying a flat fee of USD49 per month, take a look!"
